UO Scripts
==========

These are a collection of scripts created while working at the University of Oregon's Help Desk.

These scripts are provided as-is. By using these scripts without assistance from UO Help Desk staff member you are accepting any and all results of running these scripts, whether the results are what you want or not.

UO Help Desk staff will be able to assist you in restore your account to default settings if anything may happen to go wrong but there is no garantee that the Help Desk staff will be able to restore your customizations.
